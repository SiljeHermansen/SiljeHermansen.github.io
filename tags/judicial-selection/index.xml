      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) is probably the world’s most influential international court, functioning in many respects as a federal supreme court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of today, little research exists on how judges enter the Court and how its internal organization affects decision making.  This project opens the black box of these decision-making processes to consider governments’ and judges’ strategic behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I show that judges&#39; performance and governments&#39; political preferences are intertwined both when judges are appointed and when influence is distributed within the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;data-collection-on-decision-makers&#34;&gt;Data collection on decision makers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internal organization of the Court has become both more complex and more hierarchical over time. This data collection project maps out the decisions and decision makers within the Court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;The CJEU Database Platform: Decisions and Decision-Makers&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; with Stein Arne Brekke, Joshua Fjelstul and Daniel Naurin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article presents &lt;em&gt;The CJEU Database Platform: Decisions and Decision-Makers&lt;/em&gt;, which includes data on the universe of cases, decisions, and judges at the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). Cross-referencing data from multiple official sources, the CJEU Database Platform provides political scientists and legal scholars with an extensive collection of easily accessible, research-ready data that is compatible other data-collection projects on the CJEU. It provides a foundation for the broader CJEU Database currently being developed by a new multidisciplinary platform for research on judicial politics in the European Union (EU). In this article, we illustrate how researchers can use data from the CJEU Database Platform to study the internal politics of the Court, opening the door to new areas of theoretical and empirical research on judicial politics in the EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Judiciaries should be both independent and accountable, but while the conditions for judicial independence have been extensively studied judicial accountability is underexplored. We study how the power to hold judges accountable by deciding over their reappointments is exercised in courts with renewable terms. We theorize that appointers seek information and retain candidates that are both willing and able to have effective impact on the case law in the direction desired by the appointer. Whether such information is available depends on the organization and transparency of the court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;Effectplot_preferences_economy_CJ.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; align=&#34;right&#34; alt=&#34;Graphic showing that the likelihood of replacing a sitting judge increases with the distance between the economic preferences of the appointing and reappointing government.&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test our theory, we leverage institutional features of the Court of Justice of the European Union. We demonstrate how renewable terms in the EU is both incentivizing judicial performance and constitutes a powerful mechanism for judicial accountability, even in the absence of public votes. We also find that secrecy of votes does not protect judges from deselection based on political ideology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Instrument of Power or Weapon of the Weak? Litigation and Legal Representation Before the European Court of Justice&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; with Louisa Boulaziz and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tommasopavone.com/&#34;&gt;Tommaso Pavone&lt;/a&gt; presented at EUSA 2022 (Miami)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proliferation of regional organizations and international courts has expanded opportunities for nongovernmental actors to pursue transnational litigation. In the European Union (EU) legal mobilization before the European Court of Justice (ECJ) has been particularly vigorous, yet a core puzzle remains unresolved: Does litigating at the ECJ empower the &amp;lsquo;have nots&amp;rsquo;, or does it reinforce the voice of the &amp;lsquo;haves&amp;rsquo;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some studies point to the judicial expansion of EU rights protections, others stress the resource advantages of corporate litigants and their ability to mobilize specialist &amp;lsquo;Euro-lawyers.&amp;rsquo; Drawing on party capability theories and leveraging the first dataset of parties and lawyers in all national court cases referred to the ECJ, we assess whether businesses increasingly obtain better legal representation before the Court and how this advantage shapes judicial policymaking. Our longitudinal results illuminate shifting patterns of legal mobilization that partially reconcile the debate over whether litigation before the ECJ tends to advance individual rights or magnify corporate power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Litigating in the European Court of Justice: Lawyers&#39; influence on supranational decision-making&lt;/strong&gt; with Louisa Boulaziz and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tommasopavone.com/&#34;&gt;Tommaso Pavone&lt;/a&gt; presented at ECPR 2021 (zoom)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper assesses how private litigants’ propensity to win cases before international courts is conditioned by the quality of their legal counsel and by the constraints of intergovernmental politics. Building on legal mobilization and party capability theories, we argue that quality legal counsel bolsters a private party’s capacity to convey legal information to judges that is relevant to deciding the case in their favor. At the same time, we build on intergovernmentalist theories of international adjudication positing that judges will also be sensitive to political signals by national governments. As a result, we hypothesize that the influence of quality legal counsel on international judges is conditioned by the political support that member states&#39; express.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assess these claims, we exploit an original dataset of parties and lawyers involved in disputes before the European Court of Justice (ECJ) – arguably the most successful and influential international court procuring access to private litigants. We find being represented by a lawyer bolsters the probability that litigants submit observations and win cases before the ECJ, yet this effect is the highest in the minority of cases where a majority of more member state governments intervene in favor of the applicant. We conclude by highlighting the necessity of combining theories of legal mobilization and intergovernmental politics in order to explain judicial decision-making in international courts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--* **&#34;Measuring the evolution of CJEU case law using word embeddings&#34;** presented at Big Insight - a center for research-based innovation, Norwegian Computing Center 2019 (Oslo)

To study the conditions for judicial activism – self-restraint, initiation or expansion of case law – we need a consistent and comparable measure of court output. Can machine learning help us in this respect? This research note discusses ways of comparing court documents in order to obtain such measures. The focus is on word embeddings, which allow researchers to identify similar – but not identical – terms and use them as building blocks for document-level comparisons.

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;Effect_of_judgment_similarity_on_academic_attention.png&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; align=&#34;left&#34; alt=&#34;Effect of judgment similarity on academic attention (annotations in legal journals).&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

Analyzing the evolution of case law requires researchers to read and compare judgments. It is a resource-intensive process both in terms of competence and number of working hours. Assessing the outcome of a case typically requires familiarity with legal precedent in the court, the doctrines under- pinning rulings as well at the type of cases brought before the tribunal. In other words, - depending on the task – the researcher needs a good grasp of similar cases in the past (i.e. legal precedent) and/or the future (i.e. its value as a precedent) as well as the field-specific vocabulary.

The purpose of this research note is to train a model to make such comparisons for us. To obtain word embeddings, I apply a word2vec algorithm on 30999 (machine-readable) legal texts produced by the members of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) itself. I use these to construct a do- main specific vocabulary of similar words. The similarities can then be used to identify and compare relevant documents based on their word occurrences.

&lt;p&gt;If who makes decisions within courts matters for the outcome of cases and their reception, then studying how cases and judges are matched is essential to understanding judicial independence.&lt;/p&gt;
