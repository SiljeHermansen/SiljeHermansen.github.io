&lt;p&gt;The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) is probably the world’s most influential international court, functioning in many respects as a federal supreme court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of today, little research exists on how judges enter the Court and how its internal organization affect decision making.  This project opens the black box of these decision-making processes to consider governments’ and judges’ strategic behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I show that judges&amp;rsquo; performance and governments&amp;rsquo; political preferences are intertwined both when judges are appointed and when cases are allocated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!---* &lt;a href=&#34;TendingTheBar_Hermansen.pdf&#34; style=&#34;color: #000000&#34;&gt;**&#34;Tending the Bar: Strategic Case Allocations in
the Court of Justice of the European Union&#34;**&lt;/a&gt;   presented at EPSA Annual Meeting 2019 (Belfast)---&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If who makes decisions within courts matters for the outcome of cases and their reception, then studying how cases and judges are matched is essential to understanding judicial independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Building Legitimacy: Strategic Case Allocations in the Court of Justice of the European Union&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; presented at EPSA Annual Meeting 2019 (Belfast)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does the President of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) make strategic use of his members? Despite its considerable independence, the Court demonstrates substantial self-restraint when confronted with member states&amp;rsquo; preferences. However, to date, studies in the separation-of-powers tradition have considered judicial behavior at the organizational level. In contrast, this paper focuses on how external strategic considerations translate to individual influence &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; the CJEU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Influence in the Court is individualized and distributed at the leadership&amp;rsquo;s discretion. All cases are prepared by a ``judge-rapporteur&amp;rdquo; who acts as an agenda setter. This study argues that the President seeks to build the Court&amp;rsquo;s legitimacy by strategically allocating cases to select judges. I show that individual-level specialization is promoted and argue that it favors a consistent case law. I then argue that suspicions about judges&amp;rsquo; political accountability can polarize already politicized cases. The President shortcuts such dynamics by allocating cases to judges whose governments hold moderate political preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rely on original data on 9623 case allocations in CJEU (1980-2015). The results speak to the lingering effect of judges&amp;rsquo; renewable terms &amp;ndash; despite secret voting &amp;ndash; as well as the importance of an autonomous internal organization for judicial independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Judges whose governments hold outlying economic preferences are less likely to act as rapporteur in court cases that could divide member states.&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Measuring the evolution of CJEU case law using word embeddings&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; presented at Big Insight - a center for research-based innovation, Norwegian Computing Center 2019 (Oslo)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To study the conditions for judicial activism – self-restraint, initiation or expansion of case law – we need a consistent and comparable measure of court output. Can machine learning help us in this respect? This research note discusses ways of comparing court documents in order to obtain such measures. The focus is on word embeddings, which allow researchers to identify similar – but not identical – terms and use them as building blocks for document-level comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;Effect_of_judgment_similarity_on_academic_attention.png&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; align=&#34;left&#34; alt=&#34;Effect of judgment similarity on academic attention (annotations in legal journals).&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analyzing the evolution of case law requires researchers to read and compare judgments. It is a resource-intensive process both in terms of competence and number of working hours. Assessing the outcome of a case typically requires familiarity with legal precedent in the court, the doctrines under- pinning rulings as well at the type of cases brought before the tribunal. In other words, - depending on the task – the researcher needs a good grasp of similar cases in the past (i.e. legal precedent) and/or the future (i.e. its value as a precedent) as well as the field-specific vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this research note is to train a model to make such comparisons for us. To obtain word embeddings, I apply a word2vec algorithm on 30999 (machine-readable) legal texts produced by the members of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) itself. I use these to construct a do- main specific vocabulary of similar words. The similarities can then be used to identify and compare relevant documents based on their word occurrences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Will do? Selecting Judges on the Basis of Policy Preferences or Performance Indicators&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;  with Daniel Naurin presented at the ECPR Joint Sessions 2019 (Mons)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;!---* &lt;a href=&#34;WillDo_HermansenNaurin.pdf&#34; style=&#34;color: #000000&#34;&gt;**&#34;Will do? Selecting Judges on the Basis of Policy Preferences or Performance Indicators&#34;**&lt;/a&gt;  with Daniel Naurin presented at the ECPR Joint Sessions 2019 (Mons)---&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are governments’ appointments of judges to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) politicized? And does this prevent them for emphasizing competence? The power to select judges is key to representative institutions’ control over the judiciary. Nevertheless, while the CJEU is the most powerful of international courts and motor of the judicialization of politics in Europe, the selection criteria for judicial appointments have remained a blank in the literature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Judges in the CJEU sit for six years renewable. All cases are decided collectively and in secrecy, so the policies judges favor are unknown. However, their influence &amp;ndash; in terms of the positions they obtain –&amp;ndash; is known. We therefore start by assuming that judges are selected for their preferences, but sanctioned for their performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;Effect_of_preferences_on_change_of_judge.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; align=&#34;right&#34; alt=&#34;Graphic showing that the likelihood of replacing a sitting judge increases with the distance between the economic preferences of the appointing and reappointing government.&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We rely on original data on all potential reappointment decisions to the CJEU over a 60-year period, biographical information and key performance measures of judges’ activities at the Court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We find on the one hand that governments with different economic preferences hold different preferences over judges. That is, a change in government preferences increases the likelihood of changing the sitting judge. On the other hand, we find that governments &amp;ndash; regardless of their political preferences &amp;ndash; are more likely to retain judges who have obtained positions of influence.&lt;/p&gt;
