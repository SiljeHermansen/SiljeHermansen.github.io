&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parliamentarians receive public funding to employ staff in the constituency helping them execute their representative mandate. However, local staff is also an electoral asset. We draw on theories of personal-vote seeking to study local staff as an example of constituency service. Modelling within-individual changes in local-staff size among 1174 Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), we find that staff size increases before both European and national elections and more so in candidate-centred systems. This leads us to conclude that - despite a single staff system for all MEPs - EU citizens are represented differently depending on where they elect their members. The attempt to mend EU&#39;s democratic deficit by financing members&#39; contact with citizens further implies funding incumbent European candidates and challengers in national campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Political parties obtain influence through their choice of representatives. &lt;em&gt;Outside&lt;/em&gt; of parliament, they gain sway through the candidates for whom they secure election. &lt;em&gt;Inside&lt;/em&gt; parliament party groups shape policies through the allocation of tasks to competent members. This project delves into the mutual influence of parliamentary group allocations and the choices made by extra-parliamentary party organizations. In the center are members of Parliament whose political careers are shaped by both actors. In the center are members of Parliament whose political careers are shaped by both actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;election-seeking&#34;&gt;Election seeking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National parties do not have institutionalized presence in the EP. They enter
into an outcome-based contract similar to voters. MEPs are either rewarded by reselection or kicked out of office. Report allocations dissipate uncertainty about MEPs’ ability. They thus improve MEPs’ career prospects to the extent that parties need new information about agent quality, and to the extent that parliamentary groups can provide it.&lt;/p&gt;

* **&#34;Blurred lines between electoral and parliamentary representation:  The use of constituency staff among European Members of Parliament&#34;** with [Andreja Pegan](http://www.pegan.org/). Working paper.

Political actors receive public funding to execute their mandate. Spending that money for electoral purposes, however, undermines democratic representation.

We investigate to what extent parliamentary spending increases during campaign periods and how the electoral system affects such behavior. Specifically, we model within-individual changes in constituency-staff size among 1174 Members of the European Parliament. We find that local spending increases prior to both European and national elections and more so in candidate-centered systems.

&lt;/figure&gt;


We conclude that EU citizens are represented differently depending on their nationality. Insofar as constituency staff creates an incumbency advantage, the system also generates inequalities between candidates which public funding aims to equalize. Moreover, the attempt to mend Parliament’s democratic deficit by financing members’ contact with citizens also implies funding national electoral campaigns.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;How Do Legislated Gender Quotas Impact Representation?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; Working paper.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does biased political recruitment – and the subsequent legislation of quotas – affect the quality of women’s performance as representatives in Parliament? I draw on insights from the literature on political agency to distinguish between the effects of selection and sanction.  First, if recruitment in the absence of quotas implies higher requirements for women, then selected women are of higher quality. Second, when quotas lower the bar, new women enter office.  However, parties are less certain about the quality of these women and react by increasing accountability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I investigate representation in the European Parliament (1999-2014) before and after the legislation of quotas in several member states.  Absent quotas, I find that biased selection leads to female representatives who pursue longer careers and perform better at equal levels of effort. When quotas are legislated, parties emphasize women’s service records during reselection.  Women are thus incentivized to put in more effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;legislative-behavior&#34;&gt;Legislative behavior&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Parliament (EP) is a committee-oriented legislature; meaning that the bulk of legislative work is done in committees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parliamentary groups face a trade-off between the need for expertise and the risk of agency drift. We argue that groups allocate reports to maximize the value added by the rapporteur while limiting the drift. They prefer loyal policy experts to generalists and &amp;ndash; up to a point &amp;ndash; experienced MEPs to newcomers. Groups also balance individual demands with the collective need.&lt;/p&gt;
