&lt;p&gt;The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has established itself as the world’s most influential international court, functioning in many respects as a federal supreme court.  This project aims to better understand the conditions for -– and therefore the limits of -– the Court’s independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I open the black box of the decision-making process to consider governments’ and judges’ strategic behavior. As of today, very little research exists on how judges enter the Court and how its internal organization affect decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;case-allocation-within-the-court&#34;&gt;Case allocation within the Court&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Tending the Bar: Strategic Case Allocations in
the Court of Justice of the European Union&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; presented at EPSA 2019&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does the President of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) make strategic use of his members? To date, studies in the separation-of-powers tradition have considered the Court’s behavior at the organizational level. In contrast, this paper focuses on the effect of external strategic considerations on allocation of influence within the Court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrary to many other international courts, influence in the CJEU is individualized and distributed at the discretion of its leadership. First, I show that the President promotes individual-level specialization and argue that this favors consistency in the Court’s output. Second, I argue that suspicions about judges’ political accountability can polarize already politicized cases. The President shortcuts such dynamics by allocating cases to judges whose governments occupy a moderate position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rely on original data on allocations in 9955 cases brought before the CJEU (1980-2015). The results speak to the role of internal organization for judicial independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Will do? Selecting Judges on the Basis of Policy Preferences or Performance Indicators&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; with Daniel Naurin presented at the ECPR Joint Sessions 2019&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are governments’ appointments of judges to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) politicized? And does this prevent them for emphasizing competence? The power to select judges is key to representative institutions’ control over the judiciary. Nevertheless, while the CJEU is the most powerful of international courts and motor of the judicialization of politics in Europe, the selection criteria that governments follow have remained a blank in the literature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Judges in the CJEU sit for six years renewable. All cases are decided collectively and in secrecy, so the policies judges favor are unknown. However, their influence &amp;ndash; in terms of the positions they obtain –&amp;ndash; is known. We therefore start by assuming that judges are selected for their preferences, but sanctioned for their performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;Effect_of_preferences_on_change_of_judge.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; align=&#34;right&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We rely on original data on all potential reappointment decisions to the CJEU over a 60-year period, biographical information and key performance measures of judges’ activities at the Court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We find on the one hand that governments with different economic preferences hold different preferences over judges. That is, a change in government preferences increases the likelihood of changing the sitting judge. On the other hand, we find that governments &amp;ndash; regardless of their political preferences &amp;ndash; are more likely to retain judges who have obtained positions of influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!---![European Parliament](featured.jpg)---&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Party organizations obtain influence through their choice of representatives. Extra-parliamentary party organizations gain sway through the candidates for whom they secure election, while parliamentary party groups shape policies through the allocation of tasks to competent members. This project delves into the mutual influence of parliamentary group allocations and the choices made by extra-parliamentary party organizations. In the center are members of Parliament whose political careers are shaped by both actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!---
This project treats with partisan organization in the European Parliament (EP) and its impact on members’ (MEPs) career opportunities. National parties organize elections. Parliamentary work is organized around transnational political groups. They do not share any overarching organizational structure. My contributions pertain to the interconnected choices made by MEPs and their two party organizations.

Parliamentary groups face a trade-off between the need for expertise and the risk of agency drift. Groups allocate reports to maximize the value added by the rapporteur while limiting the drift. They prefer policy experts to generalists and -- up to a point -- experienced MEPs to newcomers. Groups also balance individual demands with the collective need. 

National parties do not have institutionalized presence in the EP. They enter
into an outcome-based contract similar to voters. MEPs are either rewarded by reselection or kicked out of office. Report allocations dissipate uncertainty about MEPs’ ability. They thus improve MEPs’ career prospects to the extent that parties need new information about agent quality, and to the extent that parliamentary groups can provide it.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;The sanction that isn’t imposed? Roll-call voting loyalty and demotion in European Parliament elections&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; with Mihail Chiru Thomas Däubler, presented at EPSA 2019&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article introduces a comprehensive data collection effortthat provides detailed election results, list ranking information, seat and vote attributes for MEPs, EP candidates and parties covering four electoral periods and legislative terms, from 1999 until the 2014 elections. The described data will facilitate a broad spectrum of empirical analyses of the EP, thus helping to improve our understanding of this unique parliamentary body. Possible applications include studies of the EP&amp;rsquo;s allegedly weak electoral connection, of whether personalized electoral systems make any difference with respect to whom is elected in the EP, or whether electoral rules mediate MEPs&amp;rsquo; career ambitions. The article illustratesthe main features of the datasets and their usefulness with brief analyses of intra-party competition in EP elections, the degree of usage of preference votes and its consequences, and the effects of voting disloyalty in the subsequent re-nomination process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Blurred Lines: The Use of Constituency-Based Assistants among Election-Seekers&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; with Andreja Pegan, presented at EPSA 2017&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do parliamentarians use their staff allowances for (re)election purposes? If so, what electoral institutions mediate that investment? We argue that local staff (&amp;ldquo;constituency staff&amp;rdquo;) is used to promote candidacies. Candidates must persuade two actors whose importance varies according to the electoral system: their party or voters. Thus, we expect that parliamentarians&amp;rsquo; investment in local staff is a function of their political ambition and the electoral system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To test the argument, we study the number of constituency hires by 1174 individual Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) over a five-year period. We find that the size follows European and national electoral cycles. Members from candidate-centered systems keep more local assistants on their pay roll, and are more responsive to the electoral calendar. In party-centered systems, reelection-seeking members also invest more locally than those who wish to exit Parliament, but the investment is lower and fluctuates less than in candidate-centered systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;How Do Legislated Gender Quotas Impact Representation?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; Working paper presented at EPSA 2016&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does biased political recruitment – and the subsequent legislation of quotas
– affect the quality of women’s performance as representatives in Parliament?
I draw on insights from the literature on political agency to distinguish between
the effects of selection and sanction.  First, if recruitment in the absence of quotas implies higher requirements for women, then selected women are of higher quality. Second, when quotas lower the bar, new women enter office.  However, parties are less certain about the quality of these women and react by increasing accountability.
I investigate representation in the European Parliament (1999-2014) before and
after the legislation of quotas in several member states.  Absent quotas, I find that biased selection leads to female representatives who pursue longer careers and perform better at equal levels of effort.  When quotas are legislated, parties emphasize women’s service records during reselection.  Women are thus incentivized to put in more effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;legislative-behavior&#34;&gt;Legislative behavior&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EUropean Parliament (EP) i a committee-oriented legislature; meaning that the bulk of legislative work is done in committees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parliamentary groups face a trade-off between the need for expertise and the risk of agency drift. Groups allocate reports to maximize the value added by the rapporteur while limiting the drift. They prefer policy experts to generalists and &amp;ndash; up to a point &amp;ndash; experienced MEPs to newcomers. Groups also balance individual demands with the collective need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Delegation of Committee Reports in the European Parliament&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; with Fang-Yi Chou and Bjørn Høyland&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Committee coordinators face a classic delegation problem when assigning re-
ports to their committee members. Although few theoretical developments have
focused on the effects of expertise on delegation, empirical studies have commonly
assumed monotonic effects. Based on the theoretical model by Fischer and Stocken
(2001), we argue that more expertise, holding preference divergence constant, has
a non-monotonic effect on the probability of being appointed as a rapporteur be-
cause of informational credibility. Employing accumulated committee service as
an expertise measure, we test this theoretical expectation on all committee report
delegations in the European Parliament from 1979 - 2014. Across both nonparametric and parametric hierarchical conditional logit models we find support for
this non-monotonic effect. The results hold across member states, political groups,
procedures, committees, and over time.&lt;/p&gt;
