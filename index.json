This project delves into the mutual influence of parliamentary group allocations and the choices made by extra-parliamentary party organizations. In the center are members of Parliament whose political careers are shaped by both actors.\nHow do these two projects connect? Political parties are policy seekers who use their power of appointment to place policy makers in salient positions at the supranational level. They maximize two selection criteria: They appoint representatives who are\n willing to change policies in the desired direction (i.e.: they have similar preferences), and that are able to change policies (i.e. they possess the right competencies to access positions of influence).  At the supranational level, the leadership delegates responsibilities among appointed members following largely the same selection criteria:\n They seek to delegate to members who share their preferences. They prefer delegating to members who are in a position to move policies.  These choices are interconnected: Parties are reliant on delegations done by the supranational leadership to access positions of influence. However, the supranational leadership is also reliant on member states to appoint members with the desired qualities. While supranational leaders may favor some members to others, they also have an obligation to use the set of members it is provided with.\nDuring my PhD, I studied this dynamic for the selection of members of the European Parliament. They are the agents of two principals: They rely on national parties to support their election to the European Parliament, but once in office, transnational group leaders allocate positions of influence.

The ultimate question is how these choices connect.\n","date":1564617600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1564617600,"objectID":"1b7f62207d2617f7491785ce1c71e57f","permalink":"/project/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/","section":"project","summary":"How do our representatives behave given how we select them?

To date, studies in the separation-of-powers tradition have considered the Court’s behavior at the organizational level. In contrast, this paper focuses on the effect of external strategic considerations on allocation of influence within the Court.\nContrary to many other international courts, influence in the CJEU is individualized and distributed at the discretion of its leadership. First, I show that the President promotes individual-level specialization and argue that this favors consistency in the Court’s output. Second, I argue that suspicions about judges’ political accountability can polarize already politicized cases. The President shortcuts such dynamics by allocating cases to judges whose governments occupy a moderate position.\nI rely on original data on allocations in 9955 cases brought before the CJEU (1980-2015). The results speak to the role of internal organization for judicial independence.\n Judges whose governments hold outlying economic preferences are less likely to act as rapporteur in court cases that could divide member states.

Selecting Judges on the Basis of Policy Preferences or Performance Indicators\u0026rdquo; with Daniel Naurin presented at the ECPR Joint Sessions 2019 (Mons)  **\"Will do? Selecting Judges on the Basis of Policy Preferences or Performance Indicators\"** with Daniel Naurin presented at the ECPR Joint Sessions 2019 (Mons)--- Are governments’ appointments of judges to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) politicized? And does this prevent them for emphasizing competence? The power to select judges is key to representative institutions’ control over the judiciary. Nevertheless, while the CJEU is the most powerful of international courts and motor of the judicialization of politics in Europe, the selection criteria that governments follow have remained a blank in the literature.\nJudges in the CJEU sit for six years renewable. All cases are decided collectively and in secrecy, so the policies judges favor are unknown. However, their influence \u0026ndash; in terms of the positions they obtain –\u0026ndash; is known. We therefore start by assuming that judges are selected for their preferences, but sanctioned for their performance.\nWe rely on original data on all potential reappointment decisions to the CJEU over a 60-year period, biographical information and key performance measures of judges’ activities at the Court.\nWe find on the one hand that governments with different economic preferences hold different preferences over judges. That is, a change in government preferences increases the likelihood of changing the sitting judge. On the other hand, we find that governments \u0026ndash; regardless of their political preferences \u0026ndash; are more likely to retain judges who have obtained positions of influence.\nA draft version can be found here.\n","date":1564617600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564617600,"objectID":"0b9f70668de9cca4c22f29d2b44c567c","permalink":"/project/court-of-justice-of-the-european-union/","publishdate":"2019-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/court-of-justice-of-the-european-union/","section":"project","summary":"I open the black box of the decision-making process to consider governments’ and judges’ strategic behavior  in the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU).","tags":["Judicial behavior","Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU)"],"title":"Decision makers in the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU)","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" --- Party organizations obtain influence through their choice of representatives.

This project delves into the mutual influence of parliamentary group allocations and the choices made by extra-parliamentary party organizations. In the center are members of Parliament whose political careers are shaped by both actors.\nElectoral behavior National parties do not have institutionalized presence in the EP. They enter into an outcome-based contract similar to voters. MEPs are either rewarded by reselection or kicked out of office. Report allocations dissipate uncertainty about MEPs’ ability. They thus improve MEPs’ career prospects to the extent that parties need new information about agent quality, and to the extent that parliamentary groups can provide it.\nOngoing work  \u0026ldquo;The sanction that isn’t imposed? Roll-call voting loyalty and demotion in European Parliament elections\u0026rdquo; with Mihail Chiru and Thomas Däubler, presented at EPSA Annual Meeting 2019 (Belfast)  This article introduces a comprehensive data collection effortthat provides detailed election results, list ranking information, seat and vote attributes for MEPs, EP candidates and parties covering four electoral periods and legislative terms, from 1999 until the 2014 elections. The described data will facilitate a broad spectrum of empirical analyses of the EP, thus helping to improve our understanding of this unique parliamentary body. Possible applications include studies of the EP\u0026rsquo;s allegedly weak electoral connection, of whether personalized electoral systems make any difference with respect to whom is elected in the EP, or whether electoral rules mediate MEPs\u0026rsquo; career ambitions. The article illustratesthe main features of the datasets and their usefulness with brief analyses of intra-party competition in EP elections, the degree of usage of preference votes and its consequences, and the effects of voting disloyalty in the subsequent re-nomination process.\n \u0026ldquo;Blurred Lines: The Use of Constituency-Based Assistants among Election-Seekers\u0026rdquo; with Andreja Pegan, presented at EPSA Annual Meeting 2017 (Vienna)  Do parliamentarians use their staff allowances for (re)election purposes? If so, what electoral institutions mediate that investment? We argue that local staff (\u0026ldquo;constituency staff\u0026rdquo;) is used to promote candidacies. Candidates must persuade two actors whose importance varies according to the electoral system: their party or voters. Thus, we expect that parliamentarians\u0026rsquo; investment in local staff is a function of their political ambition and the electoral system.\nTo test the argument, we study the number of constituency hires by 1174 individual Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) over a five-year period. We find that the size follows European and national electoral cycles. Members from candidate-centered systems keep more local assistants on their pay roll, and are more responsive to the electoral calendar. In party-centered systems, reelection-seeking members also invest more locally than those who wish to exit Parliament, but the investment is lower and fluctuates less than in candidate-centered systems.\nA draft version can be found here.\n \u0026ldquo;How Do Legislated Gender Quotas Impact Representation?\u0026rdquo; Working paper presented at EPSA Annual Meeting 2016 (Brussels)  How does biased political recruitment – and the subsequent legislation of quotas – affect the quality of women’s performance as representatives in Parliament? I draw on insights from the literature on political agency to distinguish between the effects of selection and sanction. First, if recruitment in the absence of quotas implies higher requirements for women, then selected women are of higher quality. Second, when quotas lower the bar, new women enter office. However, parties are less certain about the quality of these women and react by increasing accountability. I investigate representation in the European Parliament (1999-2014) before and after the legislation of quotas in several member states. Absent quotas, I find that biased selection leads to female representatives who pursue longer careers and perform better at equal levels of effort. When quotas are legislated, parties emphasize women’s service records during reselection. Women are thus incentivized to put in more effort.\nA draft version can be found here.\nA popularized presentation (in Norwegian) can be found here.\nPublished work  \u0026ldquo;Striving for influence: The effect of performance on candidate selection\u0026rdquo; (2018) Party Politics 24 (4), 382-396.  Legislative behavior The European Parliament (EP) is a committee-oriented legislature; meaning that the bulk of legislative work is done in committees.\nParliamentary groups face a trade-off between the need for expertise and the risk of agency drift. Groups allocate reports to maximize the value added by the rapporteur while limiting the drift. They prefer policy experts to generalists and \u0026ndash; up to a point \u0026ndash; experienced MEPs to newcomers. Groups also balance individual demands with the collective need.\nOngoing projects  \u0026ldquo;Delegation of Committee Reports in the European Parliament\u0026rdquo; with Fang-Yi Chiou and Bjørn Høyland  Committee coordinators face a classic delegation problem when assigning re- ports to their committee members. Although few theoretical developments have focused on the effects of expertise on delegation, empirical studies have commonly assumed monotonic effects. Based on the theoretical model by Fischer and Stocken (2001), we argue that more expertise, holding preference divergence constant, has a non-monotonic effect on the probability of being appointed as a rapporteur be- cause of informational credibility. Employing accumulated committee service as an expertise measure, we test this theoretical expectation on all committee report delegations in the European Parliament from 1979 - 2014. Across both nonparametric and parametric hierarchical conditional logit models we find support for this non-monotonic effect. The results hold across member states, political groups, procedures, committees, and over time.\nPublished work  \u0026rdquo;(Self-)selection and expertise among decision-makers in the European Parliament\u0026rdquo; (2018) The Journal of Legislative Studies 24 (1), 148-172.\n \u0026ldquo;Choosing Agents: Members of the European Parliament and their Political Organizations Seen through Report Allocation\u0026rdquo; (2017) Doctoral dissertation, University of Oslo.\n  ","date":1564617600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564617600,"objectID":"e9a167b3731055fa155f426aacf0eb1b","permalink":"/project/european-parliament/","publishdate":"2019-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/european-parliament/","section":"project","summary":"Members of the European Parliament obtain influence from their parliamentary groups, but hold their office because of choices made by voters and national parties.

By applying an adverse selection model, I argue that the selectorate looks to past performance to select candidates it expects will gain influence. However, the impact of performance varies according to the need for and availability of information.\nThe European Parliament (EP) provides a most-likely case for information asymmetry. Studying three elections in 11 member states, I find that the allocation of influential positions in office improves chances of reselection. The effect increases when the allocation is more selective, and when the prior uncertainty around candidacies is high. The study thus proposes a new approach to the relationship between national parties and transnational groups in the EP. It also suggests venues for research on parliamentary politics and candidate selection in general.

They are appointed by their political groups. In making these appointments, these groups need to accommodate both their collective needs and individual requests.\nThis article explores situations in which the collective need for information is prioritised: the codecision procedure. The data includes allocations over a 10-year period (2004–2014) in three of the most powerful EP committees, as well as key career choices among members.\nEP groups emphasise policy-specific expertise. They also pay attention to individual members’ requests for exposure, but only when the expected policy drift is minimal. Harsh selection during the allocation of codecision reports creates pressure to accommodate a greater selection of legislators during other attractive report allocations.
