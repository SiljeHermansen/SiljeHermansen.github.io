And how does information about their behavior affect who we retain in office?\nDecision makers in the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) \nThe Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) is probably the world’s most influential international court, functioning in many respects as a federal supreme court. Yet, as of today, little research exists on how judges enter the Court and how its internal organization affects decision making. This project considers governments’ and judges’ strategic behavior in an environment where performance and political preferences matter. Decision makers in the European Parliament (EP) \nParty organizations obtain influence through their choice of representatives. Extra-parliamentary party organizations gain sway through the candidates for whom they secure election, while parliamentary party groups shape policies through the allocation of tasks to competent members. This project delves into the mutual influence of parliamentary group allocations and the choices made by extra-parliamentary party organizations. In the center are members of Parliament whose political careers are shaped by both actors.\nHow do these two projects connect? Political parties are policy seekers who use their power of appointment to place policy makers in salient positions at the supranational level. They maximize two selection criteria: They appoint representatives who are\n willing to change policies in the desired direction (i.e.: they have similar preferences), and that are able to change policies (i.e. they possess the right competencies to access positions of influence).  At the supranational level, the leadership delegates responsibilities among appointed members following largely the same selection criteria:\n They seek to delegate to members who share their preferences. They prefer delegating to members who are in a position to move policies.  These choices are interconnected: Parties are reliant on delegations done by the supranational leadership to access positions of influence. However, the supranational leadership is also reliant on member states to appoint members with the desired qualities. While supranational leaders may favor some members to others, they also have an obligation to use the set of members it is provided with.\nDuring my PhD, I studied this dynamic for the selection of members of the European Parliament. They are the agents of two principals: They rely on national parties to support their election to the European Parliament, but once in office, transnational group leaders allocate positions of influence. During my postdoc, I study governmental parties\u0026rsquo; appointment of judges to the Court of Justice of the European Union as well as the internal distribution of influence within the Court. The ultimate question is how these choices connect.\n","date":1564617600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1564617600,"objectID":"1b7f62207d2617f7491785ce1c71e57f","permalink":"/project/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/","section":"project","summary":"How do our representatives behave given how we select them?

University of Oslo. Department of Political Science. 2019\nCourse description This course provides a toolkit for students looking to execute their own research projects using quantitative methods. We go through the statistical theory behind models, but we emphasize understanding when models are useful and how to employ them. The course helps students 1) identify appropriate statistical models that describe different data types and 2) design studies that enable causal inference (as opposed to merely establishing correlation).\nMany of the phenomena political scientists take interest in can be classified into categories or events. This includes variables like voters\u0026rsquo; choice of party, number of violent incidences in a time span or time between violent events. The course introduces students to a number of models which are specifically designed to describe the underlying phenomenon that generates such data. The focus of the first part of the course is on correlations. Our purpose is to help students gear the statistical analysis towards a realistic description of the data.\nBeyond statistical description, researchers\u0026rsquo; interest in political phenomena is often motivated by a wish to identify their causes. Causal claims focus on whether we would continue to observe $y$ even in the absence of $x$. This is a typical question when studying the effect of policies, for example. The potential outcomes framework provides a useful heuristic for assessing causal relationships. The second part of the course is devoted to a set of quantitative research designs that can be used to make causal inferences.\nLearning outcome Students will get hands-on practice by learning how to implement the various techniques and by replicating existing studies in R. Students will also learn how to present results in a manner that is understandable to a general audience, for example by using graphs and other visual tools.\nMore information about the course is available at the University of Oslo\u0026rsquo;s webpages.\n Download the syllabus   Slides  Maximum likelihood\n Logistic regression (Ward and Ahlquist, 2018, ch 3)\n  Logistic regression is the base-line example of a generalized linear model (GLM).

This project opens the black box of these decision-making processes to consider governments’ and judges’ strategic behavior.\nI show that judges\u0026rsquo; performance and governments\u0026rsquo; political preferences are intertwined both when judges are appointed and when cases are allocated.\nCase allocation within the CJEU **\"Tending the Bar: Strategic Case Allocations in the Court of Justice of the European Union\"** presented at EPSA Annual Meeting 2019 (Belfast)--- If who makes decisions within courts matters for the outcome of cases and their reception, then studying how cases and judges are matched is essential to understanding judicial independence.\n \u0026ldquo;Building Legitimacy: Strategic Case Allocations in the Court of Justice of the European Union\u0026rdquo; presented at EPSA Annual Meeting 2019 (Belfast)  Does the President of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) make strategic use of his members? Despite its considerable independence, the Court demonstrates substantial self-restraint when confronted with member states\u0026rsquo; preferences. However, to date, studies in the separation-of-powers tradition have considered judicial behavior at the organizational level. In contrast, this paper focuses on how external strategic considerations translate to individual influence within the CJEU.\nInfluence in the Court is individualized and distributed at the leadership\u0026rsquo;s discretion. All cases are prepared by a ``judge-rapporteur\u0026rdquo; who acts as an agenda setter. This study argues that the President seeks to build the Court\u0026rsquo;s legitimacy by strategically allocating cases to select judges. I show that individual-level specialization is promoted and argue that it favors a consistent case law. I then argue that suspicions about judges\u0026rsquo; political accountability can polarize already politicized cases. The President shortcuts such dynamics by allocating cases to judges whose governments hold moderate political preferences.\nI rely on original data on 9623 case allocations in CJEU (1980-2015). The results speak to the lingering effect of judges\u0026rsquo; renewable terms \u0026ndash; despite secret voting \u0026ndash; as well as the importance of an autonomous internal organization for judicial independence.\n Judges whose governments hold outlying economic preferences are less likely to act as rapporteur in court cases that could divide member states.

Selecting Judges on the Basis of Policy Preferences or Performance Indicators\u0026rdquo; with Daniel Naurin presented at the ECPR Joint Sessions 2019 (Mons)  **\"Will do? Selecting Judges on the Basis of Policy Preferences or Performance Indicators\"** with Daniel Naurin presented at the ECPR Joint Sessions 2019 (Mons)--- Are governments’ appointments of judges to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) politicized? And does this prevent them for emphasizing competence? The power to select judges is key to representative institutions’ control over the judiciary. Nevertheless, while the CJEU is the most powerful of international courts and motor of the judicialization of politics in Europe, the selection criteria for judicial appointments have remained a blank in the literature.\nJudges in the CJEU sit for six years renewable. All cases are decided collectively and in secrecy, so the policies judges favor are unknown. However, their influence \u0026ndash; in terms of the positions they obtain –\u0026ndash; is known. We therefore start by assuming that judges are selected for their preferences, but sanctioned for their performance.\nWe rely on original data on all potential reappointment decisions to the CJEU over a 60-year period, biographical information and key performance measures of judges’ activities at the Court.\nWe find on the one hand that governments with different economic preferences hold different preferences over judges. That is, a change in government preferences increases the likelihood of changing the sitting judge. On the other hand, we find that governments \u0026ndash; regardless of their political preferences \u0026ndash; are more likely to retain judges who have obtained positions of influence.\nA draft version can be found here.\n","date":1564617600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564617600,"objectID":"0b9f70668de9cca4c22f29d2b44c567c","permalink":"/project/court-of-justice-of-the-european-union/","publishdate":"2019-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/court-of-justice-of-the-european-union/","section":"project","summary":"I open the black box of the decision-making process to consider governments’ and judges’ strategic behavior  in the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU).","tags":["Judicial behavior","Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU)"],"title":"Decision makers in the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU)","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" --- Party organizations obtain influence through their choice of representatives.

This project delves into the mutual influence of parliamentary group allocations and the choices made by extra-parliamentary party organizations. In the center are members of Parliament whose political careers are shaped by both actors.\nElectoral behavior National parties do not have institutionalized presence in the EP. They enter into an outcome-based contract similar to voters. MEPs are either rewarded by reselection or kicked out of office. Report allocations dissipate uncertainty about MEPs’ ability. They thus improve MEPs’ career prospects to the extent that parties need new information about agent quality, and to the extent that parliamentary groups can provide it.\nOngoing work  \u0026ldquo;The sanction that isn’t imposed? Roll-call voting loyalty and demotion in European Parliament elections\u0026rdquo; with Mihail Chiru and Thomas Däubler, presented at EPSA Annual Meeting 2019 (Belfast)  This article introduces a comprehensive data collection effortthat provides detailed election results, list ranking information, seat and vote attributes for MEPs, EP candidates and parties covering four electoral periods and legislative terms, from 1999 until the 2014 elections. The described data will facilitate a broad spectrum of empirical analyses of the EP, thus helping to improve our understanding of this unique parliamentary body. Possible applications include studies of the EP\u0026rsquo;s allegedly weak electoral connection, of whether personalized electoral systems make any difference with respect to whom is elected in the EP, or whether electoral rules mediate MEPs\u0026rsquo; career ambitions. The article illustratesthe main features of the datasets and their usefulness with brief analyses of intra-party competition in EP elections, the degree of usage of preference votes and its consequences, and the effects of voting disloyalty in the subsequent re-nomination process.\n \u0026ldquo;Blurred lines between electoral and parliamentary representation: The use of constituency staff among European Members of Parliament\u0026rdquo; with Andreja Pegan, presented at EPSA Annual Meeting 2017 (Vienna)  Political actors receive public funding to execute their mandate. Spending that money for electoral purposes, however, undermines democratic representation.\nWe investigate to what extent parliamentary spending increases during campaign periods and how the electoral system affects such behavior. Specifically, we model within-individual changes in constituency-staff size among 1174 Members of the European Parliament. We find that local spending increases prior to both European and national elections and more so in candidate-centered systems.\n  We conclude that EU citizens are represented differently depending on their nationality. Insofar as constituency staff creates an incumbency advantage, the system also generates inequalities between candidates which public funding aims to equalize. Moreover, the attempt to mend Parliament’s democratic deficit by financing members’ contact with citizens also implies funding national electoral campaigns.\nA draft version can be found here.\n \u0026ldquo;How Do Legislated Gender Quotas Impact Representation?\u0026rdquo; Working paper presented at EPSA Annual Meeting 2016 (Brussels)  How does biased political recruitment – and the subsequent legislation of quotas – affect the quality of women’s performance as representatives in Parliament? I draw on insights from the literature on political agency to distinguish between the effects of selection and sanction. First, if recruitment in the absence of quotas implies higher requirements for women, then selected women are of higher quality. Second, when quotas lower the bar, new women enter office. However, parties are less certain about the quality of these women and react by increasing accountability.\nI investigate representation in the European Parliament (1999-2014) before and after the legislation of quotas in several member states. Absent quotas, I find that biased selection leads to female representatives who pursue longer careers and perform better at equal levels of effort. When quotas are legislated, parties emphasize women’s service records during reselection. Women are thus incentivized to put in more effort.\nA draft version can be found here.\nA popularized presentation (in Norwegian) can be found here.\nPublished work  \u0026ldquo;Striving for influence: The effect of performance on candidate selection\u0026rdquo; (2018) Party Politics 24 (4), 382-396.  Legislative behavior The European Parliament (EP) is a committee-oriented legislature; meaning that the bulk of legislative work is done in committees.\nParliamentary groups face a trade-off between the need for expertise and the risk of agency drift. Groups allocate reports to maximize the value added by the rapporteur while limiting the drift. They prefer policy experts to generalists and \u0026ndash; up to a point \u0026ndash; experienced MEPs to newcomers. Groups also balance individual demands with the collective need.\nOngoing projects  \u0026ldquo;Delegation of Committee Reports in the European Parliament\u0026rdquo; with Fang-Yi Chiou and Bjørn Høyland  Committee coordinators face a classic delegation problem when assigning re ports to their committee members. Although few theoretical developments have focused on the eﬀects of expertise on delegation, empirical studies have commonly assumed monotonic eﬀects. Based on the theoretical model by Fischer and Stocken (2001), we argue that more expertise, holding preference divergence constant, has a non-monotonic eﬀect on the probability of being appointed as a rapporteur because of informational credibility. Employing accumulated committee service as an expertise measure, we test this theoretical expectation on all committee report delegations in the European Parliament from 1979 - 2014. Across both nonparametric and parametric hierarchical conditional logit models we ﬁnd support for this non-monotonic effect. The results hold across member states, political groups, procedures, committees, and over time.\nPublished work  \u0026rdquo;(Self-)selection and expertise among decision-makers in the European Parliament\u0026rdquo; (2018) The Journal of Legislative Studies 24 (1), 148-172.\n \u0026ldquo;Choosing Agents: Members of the European Parliament and their Political Organizations Seen through Report Allocation\u0026rdquo; (2017) Doctoral dissertation, University of Oslo.\n  ","date":1564617600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564617600,"objectID":"e9a167b3731055fa155f426aacf0eb1b","permalink":"/project/european-parliament/","publishdate":"2019-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/european-parliament/","section":"project","summary":"Members of the European Parliament obtain influence from their parliamentary groups, but hold their office because of choices made by voters and national parties.

By applying an adverse selection model, I argue that the selectorate looks to past performance to select candidates it expects will gain influence. However, the impact of performance varies according to the need for and availability of information.\nThe European Parliament (EP) provides a most-likely case for information asymmetry. Studying three elections in 11 member states, I find that the allocation of influential positions in office improves chances of reselection. The effect increases when the allocation is more selective, and when the prior uncertainty around candidacies is high. The study thus proposes a new approach to the relationship between national parties and transnational groups in the EP.

They are appointed by their political groups. In making these appointments, these groups need to accommodate both their collective needs and individual requests.\nThis article explores situations in which the collective need for information is prioritised: the codecision procedure. The data includes allocations over a 10-year period (2004–2014) in three of the most powerful EP committees, as well as key career choices among members.\nEP groups emphasise policy-specific expertise. They also pay attention to individual members’ requests for exposure, but only when the expected policy drift is minimal. Harsh selection during the allocation of codecision reports creates pressure to accommodate a greater selection of legislators during other attractive report allocations. Own-initiative reports therefore affect allocation of codecision reports negatively.\nOnline supplementary files can be downloaded here\nReference\n Hermansen, Silje Synnøve Lyder (2018) \u0026ldquo;(Self-)selection and expertise among decision-makers in the European Parliament\u0026rdquo;, The Journal of Legislative Studies, 24 (1), pp 148-172.

National parties organize elections. Parliamentary work is organized around transnational political groups. They do not share any overarching organizational structure. My contributions pertain to the interconnected choices made by MEPs and their two party organizations.\nParliamentary groups face a trade-off between the need for expertise and the risk of agency drift. Groups allocate reports to maximize the value added by the rapporteur while limiting the drift. They prefer policy experts to generalists and -- up to a point -- experienced MEPs to newcomers. Groups also balance individual demands with the collective need.\nNational parties do not have institutionalized presence in the EP. They enter into an outcome-based contract similar to voters. MEPs are either rewarded by reselection or kicked out of office. Report alloca-tions dissipate uncertainty about MEPs’ ability. They thus improve MEPs’ career prospects to the extent that parties need new information about agent quality, and to the extent that parliamentary groups can provide it.\n","date":1489104000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1489104000,"objectID":"6668b1b7dc2ab5d1c654c4ed69d0777e","permalink":"/publication/phd2017/","publishdate":"2017-03-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/phd2017/","section":"publication","summary":"(2017) Doctoral dissertation, University of Oslo, 323 p.
